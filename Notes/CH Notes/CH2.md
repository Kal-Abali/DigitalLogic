-Boolean Alg

​	-1)Closure

  - a Set is closed with respect to a binary operator if
    		- for every set of elements of the set, the binary operator specifies a rule for obtaining a unique element of the set
- a binary operator is a rule that  assigns to each pair of unique elements of the set,  a unique element from the same set.
  - if a*b = c
  - (a,b) are in the set
  - c is also in the set
  - ** would be the binary operator

-Boolean alg was developed by George Boole

-boolean functions are equivalent to algebraic expressions

-the complement a boolean function is denoted as F'

​		-obtained by interchaninging the 0's for 1's and vice versa, in the original function F

​		-basically just inverse the whole function to get the F'
